when you're in the bad especially when
you're young you know redevelop
self-esteem you know by the age of seven
if you're if you're not good by the age
of seven or eight years old you have a
good chance of being the rest of your
life so if you're parents or or you came
up wrong and then seven or eight if you
don't have the self-esteem but you fuing
grind you're like I want to be better
when you get to where where I got or or
where I
am it's almost like you can't believe
the journey like I talked about in that
VFW in the first chapter of that book
man I'm sitting in that audience all
those people now I'm about to get the
you know americanism award and I was
grinding so hard I never took time to
reflect in my life and this was like
time to reflect and I was all kind of up
I got on stage man just cried for like
59 seconds and it was such an emotional
moment for me that iing that I did what
I did and I I overcame and it was
it was alone man you know a lot of
people have like teammates
anding like you know family push my my
mom was struggling bro she was strugg so
it was like me and my mom and so it's a
lot of just me so when you're waking up
every morning by yourself and you're
fing getting after by yourself and and
it's the it's the hidden work people see
a one minute you know video of me
running like like these Fighters you
know they they see him during the fight
or after the fight they don't see these
man what they deal with
every fing day I'm not good enough I'm
not good enough I shouldn't be here I
shouldn't be here because every day
they're even though they're fuing the
best in the world that little
at seven or eight years old
is still in there saying oh man we we
don't have so we're not good enough
we're not we shouldn't be here so you're
always fighting that even
though you beat it you never truly beat
it so when they get on stage and talking
to Joe Rogan it's it's not even real
it's not even real all those Ms that you
didn't want to get up and and I look at
it as like
aing like a rock and you find this rock
and that rock is you and every day
youing fight not wanting to get up and
you do anyway you chip another piece off
that fing Rock and every day youing eat
the right foods and every day you go to
train you train harder and harder and
harder and harder and you get up earlier
and all these things you do to start
forming yourself you're chipping
anothering piece of that rock up me
before you know it you have this
beautiful piece of artwork that that you
built but people don't and then once you
get there you see it and it becomes real
like oh my goding did this and so like
the Journey becomes so real then
but so many people aren't willing to
chip away at that stone that is
them to start chipping off those rough
edges when I was a seal recruiter I got
invited to MIT smart ass 
there man I'm not that I'm this a
garanimal I'm a knuckle dragger there
was this guy there I forget his name but
he was like the top head head guy guy
old white guy you know all all genius
out and we were on this panel and they
were asking us all these questions about
the Mind mental toughness and Sh he was
answering them and I wasn't answering
any questions and I'll never forget he
was just answering them off of theory he
never put his fing ass in you read a
bunch of books and you think that you
know how the mind works and I
had gone through hell since a kid and
then all the way up until now so I
know so that theory is yeah
there's a lot of good stuff out there
you can read from people but I had lived
hell and when you put yourself in hell
that's the only time you can figure out
how to to get through that mother you
can't read somebody else's book about
some theory on how to do some guy who
sat up in a nice warm office and read
and wrote some book with a nice cup of
coffee in theing hand no I want to see
that guy who immersed himself in 
hell and he thought about quitting and
leaving and and his wife and his kids
and why am I here is this is it worth it
all this crazy is still said and found
out a way to get through it so basically
that's that's the bottom line of it all
we all want to read about how we can
quickly get somewhere that's why there
six minute abs and all sort so
powerful did you may get some results
from it but they're not permanent the
permanent result comes from youing I say
it all the time you have to
suffer you have to make that a tattoo on
your brain so when that hard
time comes again you don't forget it you
may forget it for a second but you can
go back in the cookie jar I call it it's
a it's something that we've all endured
I call it the cookie jar and we often
forget how hard we are but you got to
reflect back take a couple seconds
reflect I've been through this I've been
through that and then remind yourself
I'm a bad
and then you get through
that but if you don't believe it you
haven't
endured you're just blowing smoke man
and you're not going be get through
anything we all have a cookie jar inside
us because life being what it is has
always tested us even if you're feeling
low and beat down by life right now I
guarantee you can think of a time or two
when you overcame odds and tasted
success it doesn't have to be a big
victory either it can be something
small I know we all want the whole
Victory today but when I was teaching
myself to
read I would be happy when I could
understand every word in a single
paragraph I knew I still had a long way
to go to move from a third grade reading
level to that of a senior in high school
but even a small win like that was
enough to keep me
interested in learning and finding more
Within Myself you don't drop 100 lb in
less than 3 months without losing 5 lbs
in a week first those first 5 lbs I lost
were a small accomplishment and it
doesn't sound like a lot but at the time
it was proof that I could lose weight
and that my goal however improbable was
not impossible the engine in a rocket
ship does not fire without a small spark
first we all need small Sparks small
accomplishments in our lives to fuel the
big ones think of your small
accomplishments as kindling when you
want a bonfire you don't start by
lighting a big log
you collect some witch's hair a small
pile of hay or some dry dead grass you
light that and then add small sticks and
bigger sticks before you feed your tree
stump into the blaze because it's the
small Sparks which start small fires
that eventually build enough heat to
burn the whole Forest down if you don't
have any big accomplishments to draw on
yet so be it your small victories are
your cookies to savor and make sure you
do Savor them yeah I was hard on myself
when I looked in the accountability
mirror but I also praised myself
whenever I could claim a small victory
because we all need that and very few of
us take the time to celebrate our
successes sure in the moment we might
enjoy them but do we ever look back on
them and feel that win again and again
maybe that sounds narcissistic to
you but I'm not talking about droning on
and bullshitting about the Glory Days
here I'm not suggesting you crawl up
your own ass and bore your friends with
all your stories about what a badass you
used to be nobody wants to hear that I'm
talking about utilizing past successes
to fuel you to new and bigger ones
because In the Heat of battle when gets
real we need to draw inspiration to push
through our own exhaustion depression
pain and misery we need to spark a bunch
of small fires to become the mothering
Inferno but digging into the cookie jar
when things are going south takes focus
and determination because at first the
brain doesn't want to go there it wants
to remind you that you're suffering U
Ing and that your goal is impossible it
wants to stop you so it can stop the
pain that night in San Diego was the
most difficult night of my life
physically I'd never felt so broken and
there were no souls to take I wasn't
competing for a
trophy there was no one standing in my
way all I had to draw on to keep myself
going was me the cookie jar became my
energy
Bank whenever the pain got to be too
much I dug into it and took a bite the
pain was never gone but I only felt it
in waves because my brain was otherwise
occupied which allowed me to drown out
the simple questions and Shrink time
each lap became a Victory lap
celebrating a different cookie another
small fire mile 881 became 82 and an
hour and a half later I was in the '90s
I'd run 9 fing miles with no training
who does that an hour later I was
at 95 and after nearly 19 hours of
running almost non-stop I'd done it I'd
hit 100 miles or had I I couldn't
remember so I ran one more lap just to
make sure whether you are running on a
treadmill or doing a set of push-ups get
to the point where you are so tired and
in pain that your mind is begging you to
stop then push just 5 to 10% further if
the most push-ups you have ever done is
100 in a workout do 105 or 110 if you
normally run 30 Mi each week run 10%
more next week this gradual ramp up will
help prevent injury and allow your body
and mind to slowly adapt to your new
workload it also resets your Baseline
which is important because you're about
to increase your workload another 5 to
10% the following week and the week
after that there is so much pain and
suffering involved in physical
challenges that it's the best training
to take command of your inner dialogue
and the Newfound mental strength and
confidence you gain by continuing to
push yourself physically will carry over
to other aspects in your
life you will realize that if you were
underperforming in your physical
challenges there's a good chance you are
underperforming at school and work too
the bottom line is that life is one big
mind game the only person you're playing
against is yourself stick with this
process and soon what you thought was
impossible will be something you do
everying day of your life

where I come from a lot of you guys come
from Dark Places just as dark as mine
maybe even darker there's going to be
times in your life when you don't want
to wake up you don't want to go to work
there's going to be times in your life
where you don't think you're good enough
where your family your wife your
girlfriend your husband your significant
other is going to doubt you you a lot of
times you doubt
yourself in
life nothing is promised to us and so we
take that mentality and we use it as woe
was me I'm not good enough I'm not smart
enough I'm not goodlooking enough I
didn't get that lucky break that's the
one thing I hate about people in life
man they're looking for this great lucky
break the lucky break that you have
right now is that you woke the 
up here's your lucky
break
now there's something I came up with a
long time ago because I would always get
tired i' always be down but I always had
to keep on
going when times get hard and you're
looking around no one's there to Pat you
on your back ain't no more 
to carry them damn boats it's just you
dragging it just drag in the boat by
yourself and all you want to do is stop
but you
can't so all you out here just know one
thing don't stop when you're 
tired stop when you're done
you want to be as hard as you can be you
don't want to be as hard as me man
sometimes being as hard as me is not a
great thing you want to make sure you
can be as hard as you can be so you know
that's that's all like like a relative
scale so but I will tell you this if you
think you
can and you're not you are failing
yourself so that's kind of like the
scale the the scale is is a is a it's a
moving Target for
everybody but people go man why are you
going so hard every day David because I
know I
can't so if you know you can do more and
you're not that's the
scale so always think that in the back
of your head like if you run 13 miles
and you get home and you feel good
that's a good thing but always know like
you know I felt good I I can go further
next time I always keep that that skill
in your mind so you I know you love pain
you're like pain pain pain so what if
like I have a back injury right now and
it's like I know I could do more but it
hurts so I'm like okay no it hurts I
need to stop whereas you would be like
my feet are bleeding my elbows are
falling off I'm gonna go like I want to
be that see people give me wrong with
that pain sh yeah I don't I don't love
pain I so I so so this is a good
conversation okay I don't love pain it's
just sometimes some of the things I do
pain is a part of the
process and you have to know how to
manage pain but also know when pain is
becoming something that you can't
manage you need to
stop but for me I've been managing pain
my entire life so once again my pain
tolerance and me knowing how far I can
push
myself it it's it's it's very it's way
out there I know it's the body I know it
the mind I know what it can take but
once again that's a very moving scale
for a lot of
people so yeah so definitely make sure
that you understand that it's not that I
love pain that I know that sometimes I
push myself to a point where pain is
just going to
happen and then within that pain I know
how to manage pain very well it's so
easy to be great nowadays because so
many people are focused on efficiency
getting the most for themselves with the
least amount of time and effort let all
of them leave the gym early skip school
take sick days commit to becoming the
with a never ending task
list this is where you make up the
difference in potential by learning to
maximize what you do have you will not
only level the playing field but also
surpass those born with more natural
ability and advantages than you let your
hours become days then weeks then years
of effort allow discipline to seep into
your CS until work becomes a reflex as
automatic is breathing with discipline
as your medium your life will become a
work of art discipline builds mental
endurance because when effort is your
main priority you stop looking for
everything to be enjoyable our phones
and social media have turned too many of
us inside out with envy and greed as we
get inundated with other people's
success their new cars and houses big
contracts Resort vacations and romantic
getaways we see how much fun everyone
else is having and feel like the world
is passing Us by so we B about it and
then wonder why we are not where we are
not where we want to be when you become
disciplined you don't have time for that
your insecurities become alarm
Bells reminding you that doing your
chores or homework to the utmost of your
ability and putting in extra time on the
job or in the gym or requirements for a
life well- lived a drive for self
optimization and daily repetition will
build your capacity for work and give
you confidence that you can take on more
with discipline as your engine your
workload and output will double then
triple What You Won't See at least not
at first is the fact that your own
personal evolution ution has begun to
bear fruit you won't see it because
you'll be too busy taking action
discipline does not have a belief system
it transcends class color and gender it
cuts through all the noise and strife if
you think that you are behind the
eightball for whatever reason discipline
is the great equalizer it erases all
disadvantages nowadays it doesn't matter
where you are from or who you are if you
are disciplined
there will be no stopping you why do you
turn around and and and take that
responsibility on because you're saying
that hey I don't want to get off and run
but I know I've got 2.3 million people
I've got a bunch of people that are
looking at it you don't need you could
walk away from it why do you do it cuz I
know that's the only place where growth
happens it's the only place man I never
forget when I was younger and I lived in
a$7 month place and it up
everything was jacked up I would for I
had a pair of jeans and every I never
forget this as long as I live you know
first day of school people go school
shopping right week out two weeks out
maybe a month out we didn't have any
money to do that saw this pair of jeans
that the inside of the pocket was
green the inside the pocket was green I
wore them almost everying day so what I
did for the next year of school was I
cut that pocket out so the green would
show so look like a new pair of
jeans all I wanted was money
all I wanted was a nice car was a nice
home and the second I got the money to
do
it I
realized this is that's why I
don't own a car I don't own a place I
don't own you will see me wearing
the same every day
I don't hide where none of that nothing
nothing what I realized is all I wanted
in my life was was look at that fcker
and that accountability mirror and be
proud of and everything else went away
while you need money to be successful
you need money to live you need money
money does buy a form of happiness cuz
without it you're 
miserable but once I
realize it doesn't mean it doesn't
mean for me what makes you
happy
achievement reaching goals a
accomplishing things that I thought were
impossible to accomplish
because why I don't smile all the time
there's this feeling inside of me that
no one very few people have very few
people have because when you come from
where I came from nothing and you make
something out of nothing the feeling it
stays with you all day and long and it
allows you to be who you want to be in
front of anybody pity is a soothing bomb
that turns toxic at first when your
family and friends commiserate with you
and validate the reasons you have for
grumbling about your circumstances it
lands like sympathy but the more Comfort
pity brings you the more external
validation you'll crave and the less
independent you will
become this will make it that much more
difficult for you to gain any traction
in life that's the Vicious Cycle of pity
it's saps self-esteem and Inner Strength
which makes it harder to succeed and
with each subsequent failure you will be
more tempted to pity yourself look I get
it life isn't fair or easy a lot of us
are doing a job that we don't want to
do we feel we are above the tasks coming
our way and that the world or God or the
fates have sentenced us to live in a box
we do not belong in
when I was a night shift security guard
at a local hospital I felt that work was
beneath me so I showed up every night
with a voice in my head screaming I
don't want to be here and that infected
everything about my life I ate my
feelings blew up and slipped into a deep
depression I wanted a different life but
my shitty attitude made it impossible to
create one every minute you spend
feeling sorry sorry for yourself is
another minute not getting better
another morning you miss at the gym
another evening wasted without studying
another day burned when you didn't make
any progress towards your
dreams Ambitions and deepest desires the
ones you've had in your head and heart
your entire life every minute you spend
feeling sorry for yourself is another
minute spent in the dungeon thinking
about what you lost or the opportunities
that have been snatched away or
squandered which inevitably leads to the
Great Depression when you are depressed
you are likely believe that nobody
understands you or your plight the only
thing that ever matters is the present
moment yet too many people let their
depression or regret hijack their
day they let their feelings about the
past hijack their lives perhaps their
fiance left them at the altar or they
got fired without cause
guess what one day they will pan back
and realize that nobodying cared about
any of that but them I don't care what
you've been through I can feel bad for
you I can have sympathy for you but my
sympathy won't get you
anywhere when I was a young damaged kid
feeling sorry for myself didn't help me
what helped was cleaning those white
walls right the first time we cannot get
time back so we must be minute Hoarders
the earlier I get up the more I do the
less time I stay in pity party feel
sorry for myself land the stronger I
become and the more Daylight I see
between me and everyone else when you
separate yourself from the pack by
cultivating the values and priorities
that lead to Greatness mountains of
adversity and hardship become speed
bumps and that makes it easier to adapt
to the road ahead and build the new life
or sense of self you crave when you
adapt you will begin to see everything
that comes your way as a stepping stone
on your progression toward a higher
plane High pain esteemed jobs are
generally not entry level you have to
start
somewhere but most people see the
thankless tasks that must be completed
in order to advance as burdens instead
of
opportunities that makes it impossible
for them to learn you got to find the
lesson in every shitty task or low- wage
job that requires humility I wasn't
humble enough to appreciate my
experience and security so my attitude
was foul as I thought I deserve much
better oblivious to the fact that almost
everybody starts at the bottom and from
there it's attitude and action that
determine the future humility is the
antidote to self-pity it keeps you
rooted in reality and your emotions in
check I'm not suggesting you should be
satisfied with an entry-level job I'm
never satisfied but you must appreciate
what you have while staying hungry
enough to learn everything you can you
need to learn to wash the dishes flip
the burgers sweat over the deep fryer
sweep up the job site work in the mail
room and answer the
phones that's how you build proficiency
it's important to learn every aspect of
any business before you move up you
can't rise if you're weighed down by
bitterness and
entitlement humility hardens your spine
and encourages you to stand tall secure
in yourself no matter what anyone else
thinks and that has tremendous value
