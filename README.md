# HyrdaAlert
The purpose of this project is so that I can read a spreadsheet of times I need to drink water to text me when I need to drink more water throughout my day. 
## Description
HydraAlert is made to alert athletes when they should drink water given a spreadsheet. This project was birthed from training for an Iron Man in which I realized how much water I was losing while training. HydraAlert's goal is to serve as a quirky reminder to keep hydrated at specific times throughout my day. I made it to be annoying so that I do drink water.
